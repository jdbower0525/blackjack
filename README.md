# Blackjack

Program is a basic blackjack game.  After starting the program, the user will be
given two cards.  The user can then decide whether to continue drawing cards by
'hitting' or quit drawing cards by 'standing.'

After the user makes their decisions, the computer controlled dealer tried to also
reach as close to 21 as possible without going over.  The user will then be told whether
he/she beat the dealer's hand.
